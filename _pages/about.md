Hi, I'm Ma Runze, an AI practitioner and product builder passionate about bridging cutting-edge models with real-world applications.  

I focus on applied machine learning, prompt engineering, and building lightweight, scalable AI products.

As a core member of the team behind [**IELTS Master**](https://www.zmielts.cn), an AI-driven writing feedback tool, I led prompt design and user analytics, growing the platform to over **5,000 users** and partnering with **top universities and influencers**.

I'm especially interested in using generative AI to create value in education, productivity, and underexplored local contexts.  

Currently open to collaboration, startup opportunities, and AI x product co-creation.

You can find my CV here:[CV](../files/resume.pdf) and Chinese version [CV_zh](../files/resume_zh.pdf).
